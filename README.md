# Weather Challenge by Mark Kanczuzewski

The purpose of this exersize was to create a weather dashboard with form inputs. Upon entering a city the search button will cause current and future weather conditions to display. The current weather conditions will display city name, date, conditions icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index. The UV Index will change colors depending on its severity. Future weather conditions will list the next five days of weather including date, conditions icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. Search history of cities are listed below the search button as buttons themselves which will pull up the current and future conditions again.
